## The work and writing for [Mig Reyes](http://mig.pizza)

### About Mig:
Iâ€™m a graphic and product designer from Chicago, leading design at [Trunk Club](http://trunkclub.com) and serving as President for [AIGA Chicago](http://chicago.aiga.org). Before Trunk Club, I cut my teeth shaping brand and product work for [Basecamp (_formerly 37signals_)](http://basecamp.com) and [Threadless](http://threadless.com).

### About this site:
This site is hand made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using Sass and CoffeeScript for assets. These are my template files to build everything at http://mig.pizza. Feel free to poke around to get ideas for your next Jekyll project.
