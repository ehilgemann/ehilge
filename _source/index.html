  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <p>
    I’d like to be a better writer. I often write about design, craft, and workplace culture. Some favorite pieces:
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">Try, try again</a>,
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3450" target="_blank">When culture turns to policy</a>,
    and <a href="http://37svn.com/3404" target="_blank">Reminder: Design is still about words</a>.
