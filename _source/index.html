  <h3>Making</h3>
  <p>I help make and market <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>, the world’s best project management software. Before Basecamp, I designed for the web at Threadless. With my roots in traditional graphic design, I also <a href="/makes">experiment outside of web and product work</a>.</p>

  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <p>
    I’m trying to be a better writer everyday. I like to write about design, craft, and culture. You can read some of my favorite pieces so far:
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">Try, try again</a>,
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3450" target="_blank">When culture turns to policy</a>,
    and <a href="http://37svn.com/3404" target="_blank">Reminder: Design is still about words</a>.
  </p>

<article class="home-speaking">
  <h3>Speaking</h3>
  <p>Every now and again I travel to give presentations on creativity and design. My last favorite talk was <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/mig-reyes">the one I gave at CreativeMornings</a>. It’s four pieces of backwards advice that captures how I feel on the way we live our lives as creators.</p>
