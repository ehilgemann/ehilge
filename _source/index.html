  <h3>Making</h3>
  <p>Before Trunk Club, I spent the past four years designing and shipping product in addition to leading brand and marketing at <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> (previously 37signals). Prior, I designed UI and marketing campaigns at Threadless. Rooted in traditional graphic design, I also <a href="/makes">experiment outside of digital work</a>.</p>

I currently serve as the President for <a href="http://chicago.aiga.org" target="_blank">AIGA Chicago</a>, working hard with my board to make the Chicago design and creative communities a more connected place. Beyond AIGA, I also teach, guest lecture, and serve on advisory boards with Chicago design and tech bootcamp organizations.</p>

  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <p>
    I’d like to be a better writer. I often write about design, craft, and workplace culture. Some favorite pieces:
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">Try, try again</a>,
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3450" target="_blank">When culture turns to policy</a>,
    and <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/reminder-design-is-still-about-words-c8ea79e6b8ca#.gglf86qgj" target="_blank">Reminder: Design is still about words</a>.

  <h3>Speaking</h3>
  <p>I travel to give presentations on creativity and design. One of my favorite talks to give is <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/mig-reyes">the one I gave at CreativeMornings</a>. It’s four pieces of weird and unusual advice that captures how I feel about living our lives as makers of things.</p>
